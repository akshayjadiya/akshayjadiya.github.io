I have done a bunch of Segmentation & Targeting projects at my work and I aim to share my learnings through this blog post. 

This article will —
1.Cover the “What” , “Why” and “How” of the S&T process
1.Give you a walkthrough of a Segmentation project using a Kaggle dataset

So, let’s dive right in!

## What is Segmentation and Targeting?

I like to think of the Segmentation process as an **analytical way of classifying customers to optimize targeting efforts**. 
I have come across two types segmentation (although, there can be more) —

- **Behavioral Segmentation** — Done using ‘secondary’ data i.e. using historical data that captures the ‘behavior’ of a customer.
- **Attitudinal Segmentation** — Float a survey having questions directed towards assessing customer preferences.
The focus of this post will be on the Behavioral Segmentation.

**Targeting** is the process of using segment definitions and corresponding characteristics to **inform marketing decisions (frequency / channel / target value etc.)**. Targeting can be thought of **prioritizing segments in a way that aligns with the marketing strategy** and optimizes resources.

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
